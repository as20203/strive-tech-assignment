My way of working:

Tasks:

1. Setting up backend project.
2. Figuring out how to get file with sha from a github repo.
3. Use langchain to pass the file content to a prompt in langchain.
4. Get quality score and the reasoning from the model (currenlty will use gpt 4)

Extensions:

1. Make the code work with pull requests and commits.
2. Add functionality to search from web to get latest coding quality standards and practices as well.

Improvements:

1. Setting up login/signup (Make a flow diagram for this.)
2. Saving history of the chat using langchain persistance layer. (make a flow diagram for this.)
